# Basic Animation using Adobe Photoshop & After Affects
### by Ariana Higgins / GitHub: arihiggs89

## Tutorial Overview
In this tutorial, I will teach you how to take an open-source image and animate this image using Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. This tutorial is for beginners who would like to learn very basic Photoshop (PS) and After Effects (AE) techniques used in media design. This tutorial does not require any experience with PS or AE, only a willingness to learn! 

## The World of Animation
Animators produce images that appear to come to life on screen. Their work is found in feature [films](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls068105923/), [commercials](https://studiotale.com/blog/best-animated-commercials/), [music videos](https://www.b2w.tv/blog/best-animated-music-videos), [video games](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=video_game&genres=animation&explore=genres), [webites](https://madebyshape.co.uk/web-design-blog/best-websites-that-use-illustration-and-animation/) and other media. They may work with drawings, specialist software or models and puppets, capturing separate images of each stage of a movement. When the images are viewed at speed, the characters appears to move. 

The French artist Ã‰mile Cohl created the first animated film using what came to be known as traditional animation methods: the 1908 Fantasmagorie. The film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. Since that time, animation has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry and the rapid advancement of technology has made computer animation available to the masses. The animation industry is one of the fastest growing industries and in recent years, there has been an increased demand for animation & visual effects in video games, movies, and television, providing growth and great pay for skilled animators.
