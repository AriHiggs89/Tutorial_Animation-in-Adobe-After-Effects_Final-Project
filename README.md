## Animation in Adobe After Affects
**by Ariana Higgins - AriHiggs89**
=================================
### Tutorial Overview:
In this tutorial, I will teach you how to take an open-source clip-art image and animate said image using Photoshop and After Effects. This tutorial is for beginners who would like to learn very basic Photoshop techniques, moving an image into After Effects, basic fade-in/fade-out, simple key-frame animation, and rendering the finished project in a multitude of formats.

Animators produce images that appear to come to life on screen. Their work is found in feature [films](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls068105923/), [commercials](https://studiotale.com/blog/best-animated-commercials/), [music videos](https://www.b2w.tv/blog/best-animated-music-videos), [video games](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=video_game&genres=animation&explore=genres), [webites](https://madebyshape.co.uk/web-design-blog/best-websites-that-use-illustration-and-animation/) and other media. They may work with drawings, specialist software or models and puppets, capturing separate images of each stage of a movement. When the images are viewed at speed the character appears to move. In recent years, there has been an increased demand for animation and visual effects in video games, movies, and television, providing growth and great pay for people skilled in animation.
