# Basic Animation using Adobe Photoshop & After Affects
### by Ariana Higgins / GitHub: arihiggs89


## Tutorial Overview
This tutorial will teach you how to animate an open-source image using Adobe Photoshop and After Effects. This tutorial is for beginners (like me) who want to learn very basic Photoshop (PS) and After Effects (AE) techniques used animation. This tutorial does not require any previous experience with PS or AE - only the willingness to learn!


## The World of Animation
Animators produce images that appear to come to life on screen. Their work is found in feature [films](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls068105923/), [commercials](https://studiotale.com/blog/best-animated-commercials/), [music videos](https://www.b2w.tv/blog/best-animated-music-videos), [video games](https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=video_game&genres=animation&explore=genres), [webites](https://madebyshape.co.uk/web-design-blog/best-websites-that-use-illustration-and-animation/) and other media. They may work with drawings, special software, graphics, models and puppets, capturing separate images of each stage of a movement. When the images are viewed at speed, the characters appear to move. 

The French artist Ã‰mile Cohl created the first animated film using what came to be known as traditional animation methods: the 1908 "Fantasmagorie". The film largely consisted of a stick figure moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. Since that time, animation has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry and the rapid advancement of technology has made computer animation available to the masses. The animation industry is one of the fastest growing sectors and in recent years, there has been an increased demand for animation & visual effects in video games, movies, and television, providing growth and great pay for skilled animators.
